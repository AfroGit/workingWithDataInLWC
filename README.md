# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

##  Lightning Data Service is the preferred (and easiest) way to work with Salesforce data. With Lightning Data Service, developers use JavaScript to connect components to Salesforce data.

Lightning Data Service also provides security by making server calls to secure User Interface API endpoints. Using a client-side shared cache across all components, Lightning Data Service maximizes performance. When a record is cached, it’s retrieved from the cache, eliminating unnecessary calls to the server.

Lightning Data Service maintains consistent, up-to-date data across multiple components and clients throughout the app lifecycle. If several components use Lightning Data Service to work with a record, and one of them updates the record, the other components automatically reflect that update.
